        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Christian Thibeau. I'm currently a grad student working on my MBA in professional accounting at <a href="https://www.canisius.edu/" target="_blank">Canisius college</a>.
            I decided to create a blog where I discuss all aspects of business for fun.
            The posts might be related to investing, economics, accounting, marketing or just about some interesting articles I read in the Wall Street Journal.</p>

        <h3>Why Does This Website Look So Dinky?</h3>
            <p>Because I'm not using a content management system. I've decided to try and build a website from scratch. No matter how hard it may be.
            This is because I'm really interested in technology and would like to gain a deep understanding of how the World Wide Web works.</p>
        
            <p>I've always wanted to learn how to code. And for the past couple years I've had an on and off relationship with coding.
            But recently I've decided to be consistent with it.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in coding too but don't know where to start I would suggest beginning with HTML and CSS, the language of webpages.
            You can get some quick wins if you start with these languages because actionable results are not far out of reach.</p>

        <h3>Where Can I Learn HMTL and CSS?</h3>
            <p>I suggest <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.
            They explain coding in an easy to understand manner and you can get great practice from the hands-on lessons and projects that are available.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, the links to my socials are below. Feel free to connect with me, reach out to chat, or let me know what kind of posts you'd wish other business blogs would make.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to start this journey and hope I can provide at least some value to you through my posts.</p>
